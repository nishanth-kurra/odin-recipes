# Recipe HTML Project

This project contains a collection of recipe web pages built using HTML. It is part of The Odin Project curriculum to practice semantic HTML structure, images, links, and lists.

## Project Overview

The project includes separate HTML pages for different recipes such as Bang Bang Salmon, Grilled Lobster Tails, and Grilled Chicken Salad with Seasonal Fruit. Each recipe page contains a title, image, description, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.

## Viewing the Project

To view the recipes, open the `index.html` file in the root folder in your browser. From the homepage, you can navigate to individual recipe pages stored in the `recipe` folder.
